MysticOS
========

Note: This is still a work in progress, so expect bugs and missing/incomplete features.

MysticOS is an Operating System for ComputerCraft.
It's been designed with the small screen size in mind. So it gives programs as
much space as possible, no windows or anything that takes space (with the
exception of the system bar).

Features
--------

*	Threads
*	Background Programs
*	Graphics Library
*	Notification System

An installer and auto-update feature will be added in the future, for now

3.	Move the files to the computer folder
